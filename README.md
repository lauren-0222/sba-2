* This project emphasizes accessibility, responsive layout, and clean semantics.<br>

# Reflection Questions<br>
1. Accessibility challenges occured while completing this project. I wanted to ensure that each feature had enough color contrast to be visually appealing. The layout needed to be designed with ARIA roles integrated into the code to make the page user friendly.
2. I used flexbos for the navigation bar and CSS grid for the services section. Layouts adapt fluidly to different screen widths and preserve content reading order. 
3. W3schools.com was a great resource for coding. I referred to the site to help with my styling and HTML & CSS.
